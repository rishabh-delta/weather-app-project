this project contains 3 components 
1. HTML FILE (overall structure for showcasing the basic attributes like temperature, time, humidity and windspeed)
2. STYLE SHEET (styling of the components)
3. JAVASCRIPT FILE (giving the functionality to the components declared in the html file.)

  ...what is new in my learning?
     i increased my grip on applying event listeners and dom events and somewhat in styling the html document.
     gained confidence in integrating the project with api datas (fetching the data and integrating it with the project files.)
